# Project Introduction: TravelTide Analytics

## **Enhancing Customer Loyalty through Data-Driven Insights (SQL extraction, EDA, standard scaling, correlation matrix, K-means) **

### **Context and Objective**
TravelTide, a notable player in the online travel industry, has established itself with its expansive travel inventory and advanced search technology. Despite its success, the company faces challenges in customer retention. To tackle this, a personalized rewards program is envisioned, focusing on aligning customer preferences with the company's offerings.

### **The Challenge**
The key to the success of this personalized rewards program lies in a deep understanding of customer behaviours and preferences. This knowledge gap needs to be filled to develop a strategy that not only attracts but also retains customers by offering relevant perks.

### **Role and Responsibility**
As a member of the Analytics team, my task was to collaborate with the marketing department to extract valuable insights from customer data. Our role is pivotal in ensuring the rewards program is attractive and tailored to individual customer needs.

### **Goals**
1. **Validate Hypothesis:** Examine if data supports the assumption that customers have specific preferences for certain rewards.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** Identify customer behaviours and preferences to assign a likely favourite perk to each customer.

### **Approach**
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Investigate travel behaviours that indicate an affinity towards specific perks.
- **Data Exploration:** Identify relevant database fields to shed light on these behaviours.
- **Data Preparation:** Ensure a logical and methodical approach to data segmentation to avoid flawed analyses.

### **Impact**
This project aims to provide critical insights for crafting a rewards program that resonates with the customer base, enhancing customer loyalty and driving the company's growth in a competitive market.
